# Colourmap Maker
- Requires Matlab image processing toolbox

## Details
A matlab script that takes an RGB image as input and then allows users to select colours from the image.

Once selected, two colourmaps are created: 
1) Short - this is simply an array of the selected colours
2) Full - this is a full colourmap with gradients between the selected colours for gradient plotting etc.

These colourmaps are displayed to the user before they are asked if they want to save. If YES, .m files are generated that can be easily loaded and used in other matlab projects
